    "One of the reasons that the Python language is extremely popular is that it makes writing programs easy. When we execute Python code, the Python interpreter converts your code into bytecode that your computer can understand, and then runs that bytecode. When you write code in Python, you don't have to worry about things like allocating memory on your computer or choosing how certain operations are done by your computer's processor. Python takes care of that for you.\n",
    "<img src=\"bytecode.svg\" />\n",
    "Python is what we call a **high-level language**. High level languages allow you to write programs faster as the interpreter makes the decisions on how to execute your instructions. In contrast, when you use **low-level languages** like ```C```, you define exactly how memory will be managed and how the processor will execute your instructions. This means that coding in a low-level language takes longer, however you have more ability to optimize your code to run faster.\n",

    "|High-Level|Python|Low|Low|\n",
    "|Low-Level|C|High|High|\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing between a high and low-level language, you have to make a trade-off between being able to work and quickly, and having programs that run quickly and efficiently. Luckily, there are two Python libraries that were created to give us the best of both-worlds: **NumPy** and **pandas**. Together, pandas and NumPy provide a powerful toolset for working with data in Python. They allow us to write code quickly without sacrificing performance. But how do they do this? What is it that makes these libraries faster than raw Python? The answer is **vectorization**.\n",
    "### How Vectorization Makes Code Faster\n",
    "Let's look at an example where we have two columns of data. Each row contains two numbers we wish to add together. Using just Python, we would use a *list* of *lists* structure to store our data, and use *for loops* to iterate over that data. Let's see what this would look like as Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"for_loop.svg\" />\n",
    "When this code is run, the Python interpreter will turn our code into bytecode, following the logic of our ```for``` loop. In each iteration of our loop, the bytecode asks our computer's processor to add the two numbers together and stores the result. The diagram shows the first calculation our computer's processor would make:\n",
    "<img src=\"unvectorized.svg\" />\n",
    "Our computer would take eight processor cycles to process the 8 rows of of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization takes advantage of a processor feature called __Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)__ to process data faster. Most modern computer processors support SIMD. SIMD allows a processor to perform the same operation, on multiple data points, in a single processor cycle. Let's look at how a vectorized version of our code above might be processed using a SIMD instruction that allows four data points to be processed at once:\n",
    "<img src=\"unvectorized.svg\" />\n",
    "The vectorized version of our code will only take two processor cycles to process our eight rows of data - a four times speed-up. Vectorized operations might process as little as two and as many as as hundreds of operations per processor cycle, depending on the capabilities of the processor and the size of each data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that you don't have to worry about SIMD and processor cycles, because NumPy and pandas take care of this for you. We'll introduce pandas in more detail later in this course, but first we're going to learn about NumPy so we understand the fundamentals of working with vectorized operations.\n",
