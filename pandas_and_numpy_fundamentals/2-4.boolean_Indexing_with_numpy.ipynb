    "In the previous mission we learned how to use NumPy and ndarrays to perform vectorized operations to work with data. We learned that NumPy makes it quick and easy to make selections of our data, and includes a number of functions and methods that make it easy to calculate statistics across the different axes (or dimensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the skills we've learned so far, we were able to select subsets of our taxi trip data and then calculate things like the maximum, minimum, sum, and mean of various columns and rows. But what if we wanted to find out how many trips were taken in each month? Or which airport is the busiest? For this we will need a new technique: **Boolean Indexing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into what boolean indexing is and how it can help us, let's take a moment to refamiliarize ourselves with our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're working with a CSV file called ```nyc_taxis.csv```, containing data from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) on taxi trips. We're working with a sampled selection of taxi trips to and from New York City airports between January and June 2016. In our dataset, each row represents a unique taxi trip. Here are the first 10 rows of our data with column labels:\n",
